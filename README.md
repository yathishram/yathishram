### Hi there 👋
### My Name is Yathish R 🦸🏼, I am a CSE gradutate working as Blockchain Developer and also as Full Stack Developer.

Well Github released this new feature to alternate as a description to the profile. So what shall you find here?
1. Some simple Dapps
2. React projects
3. Some Nodejs projects
4. My portfolio website code
5. Some sarcasm in every project. 

- I'm currently working on making a world better place  🙃. (A constant lie).
- I'm currently learning how to code better 👨‍💻 and brew the perfect cup of coffee ☕
- Ask me about how to learn Blockchain and Full stack. 


> Untold Truth: The number of commits in each repo is directly proportional the number of Stackoverflow solutions used.
